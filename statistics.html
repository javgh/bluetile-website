                    <h2><a name="about">The state of tiling window managers - a few statistics</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        These are a few numbers that I compiled to satisfy my curiousity. They are based on data
                        collected by the <a href="http://popcon.debian.org/">Debian Popularity Contest</a> and as such
                        only take Debian users into account. I have no idea how representative this is, but it's fun
                        to look at regardless. :-)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To start things off: A rough approximation of the ratio of stacking ('normal') window managers
                        to tiling window managers. This takes installations of Debian packages for a number of window
                        managers into account. I tried to pick a somewhat representative list of window managers [1], but
                        it might be totally off. =) Also: This does not take into account the recent addition of
                        tiling capabilities to KWin.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The following shows 'market share' for various tiling window managers. I tried to include
                        all TWMs that have a Debian package and a least a small installation base. Hopefully I
                        haven't overlooked any relevant projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">Awesome</a> and <a href="http://xmonad.org/">XMonad</a> are
                        usually the first projects to be mentioned when the topic of tiling
                        comes up. Together they dominate almost half of the 'TWM market'. I'm surprised
                        about the high percentage for <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> though, considering that
                        this counts the installed Debian packages which
                        you can't use, if you configure dwm (to change the configuration of dwm you have to compile from source).
                        Apparently a lot of people are happy with the defaults (?).
                    </p>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally: Growth rates for these TWMs. This shows how the respective market share of the projects
                        has changed over the last two months.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sadly, a lot of projects are actually losing users right now - or at least Debian users. It's still
                        my favorite graph though, since <a href="http://www.bluetile.org">Bluetile</a> is doing so well on it. :-)
                    </p>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And at the current rate of development, Bluetile will overtake Awesome in just under 2 and 1/2 years. ;-)
